                            An archive management system commonly wraps functions that are not part of a digital preservation system. An archive management system enables the description of digital records and the provision of context relevant or one or more archival models. A connection must exist between the archive management system and a digital preservation system to allow digital records to be retrieved by their catalogue references.

A &quot;bag&quot; consists of a &quot;payload&quot; (the arbitrary content) and &quot;tags&quot;, which are metadata files intended to document the storage and transfer of the bag. A required tag file contains a manifest listing every file in the payload together with its corresponding checksum. A bag can potentially be used as a SIP (Submission Ingest Package) in a digital preservation workflow.

                            The BitCurator initiative develops and supports open source digital forensics tools for use in libraries, archives, and museums. Their projects are:The BitCurator Access project that focuses on technologies that simplify access to raw and forensically-packaged disk images; allowing collecting institutions to provide access environments that reflect as closely as possible the original order and environmental context of these materials.The BitCurator project was a joint effort led by the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (SILS) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) to develop a system for collecting professionals that incorporates the functionality of many digital forensics tools. The project was originally (2011-2014) funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Community support and ongoing software development are managed by the BitCurator Consortium.The BitCurator Consortium, supported by Educopia, provides ongoing support for BitCurator software products and the BitCurator community.

                            If a checksum should fail for any reason, archivists also have the concept of fixity. The concept of ‘remaining fixed in state&#39;. We can observe file date ranges, e.g. modified and creation date. We can also look at the content and clues in the content for features that help us to prove a digital file is what it purports to be. There is only one Domesday Book – we have many ways of proving this is what it is without a checksum value per se.

                            A collision happens when two different data streams result in the same checksum value.This is a big concern when a checksum is used for security purposes (e.g. in password applications).A collision is computationally difficult to engineer but not impossible.Collisions could of course be incidental.An engineered collision for SHA1 recently took knowledge of the algorithm, plus 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 SHA-1 computations, 6,500 years of CPU (Central Processing Unit) time, and 110 years of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) time, to create.Collisions are not a huge concern in digital preservation because multiple checksums may often be created for a single file to avoid such a situation.Archivists also have the concept of fixity.Collisions are a bigger concern when workflows require on just a single checksum to align large amounts of data.

                            Lossy compression is a term usually applied to files that have been transformed into something, smaller, through the removal of information, but which can be replayed back to the user in a way that is approximately the same.The MP3 algorithm ‘compresses’ audio streams by removing high-frequency signals that, theoretically, human beings cannot hear, transforming the signal, and then re-encoding it.The loss of high-frequency signals equates to a loss of information, and is therefore lossy.Should a user attempt to then recompress a lossy file, the file will be compressed even further resulting in even more information loss – think photocopy of a photocopy.N.B. it is a myth that simply opening a lossy file, e.g. JPG can make it lose even more information. The user must actively choose to resave the file, and even then, choose lossy options when doing so.

                            Container signatures require the tool to first uncompress the file. Container signatures only exist for OLE2 type files (Microsoft family, plus a few others), and ZIP type files (Microsoft family, Open Office, plus a few others). First a trigger is discovered, and that trigger maps to a set of rules for identification in the container signature which may include the specification of files or folders that must exist, and optionally magic number byte sequences inside specific files.

                            A cryptographic hash function is a one way function such that the original data cannot be determined from the hash value itself – it is infeasible to invert the function. Cryptographic hashes are considered quick. The cryptographic hash functions employed in digital preservation have wide application as well and so are considerably well tested and there are many tools that can support their use in our workflows.

                            When information is hidden or modified in a way that cannot be easily read then it is said to be obfuscated. Redaction, password protection, and encryption are three such methods of obfuscation. The latter two pose risk to successful digital preservation as they impact the ability to read the information in a record. Encryption impacts the ability to read the binary content of a file entirely unless an encryption key, and a known algorithm is available to decrypt the file&#39;s contents.

                            Because a data input will always output the same checksum value, checksums are great for de-duplication, that is removal of duplicate files with the same information.In an archival context this may be more complicated where a duplicate record has multiple contexts.In some storage systems, checksums can be used to store no more than one copy of an object that can then be referenced from multiple contexts.

For example, to run Microsoft Word, a dependency may be Microsoft Windows. Configured in Microsoft Windows may be a number of software libraries that enable it to interact with your computer’s hardware configuration. As we dissect a file, or piece of software, we begin to understand what other technology it depends on to be able to run.

                            Cryptographic hashes are deterministic meaning for a given piece of data, the same output will always be generated. That is, the same checksum value.Output is, however, unpredictable between inputs meaning that similar (not the same) output results in a radically different looking checksum value so the original data cannot be predicted.

The project realized that many information professionals felt overwhelmed by the scope of the problem. Team members created a workshop curriculum based off the findings of the study and it has since been delivered to many institutions across the States. POWRR created the digital preservation tool grid, now maintained in collaboration with the COPTR tool registry.

                            Digital preservation is a function of digital curation, in which digital content is prepared and actively managed for long-term access.Digital content requires constant, active management.At the most basic level, this includes managing multiple copies in different geographic locations, ongoing and consistent comparison of the same files in multiple locations to ensure that no changes have occurred to them (this is called fixity checking).It also involves performing healing procedures when files no longer match up, and maintaining audit logs from the time of ingest into the archival system that tracks all activities, like access and changes to the files over time.

                            A DROID signature file is an XML file that contains a snapshot of PRONOM in its current state.Split into two, or three sections (for container signatures), the signature file’s two main components are a list of file formats and metadata, e.g. format MIMEType, and then a mapping to a list of signatures.A container signature file contains a third section of ‘trigger PUIDs’ that is, PUIDs that trigger container identification when a match is found.

                            An open community that is a good first place to start for discussing new file format signatures for PRONOM. Being open, folks are invited to contribute to other’s identification issues. Signatures can be shared and the workload in fixing them shared too. PRONOM development is aided when there is as much information as possible about a file format and its potential signature. This work would all have to be done by their developers otherwise.

                            EBCDIC is a legacy character encoding used in the past on IBM computers in the 1960s. EBCDIC could be used internationally through the use of code pages. Code pages by any other name were simply EBCDIC-like, that is, other character-encodings. One would need to look up Japanese, code page 930, CCSID 930, to understand how to decode an EBCDIC message encoded using this variant.

                            A false positive occurs when a format is matched incorrectly, or imprecisely in DROID or Siegfried. This can happen when the amount of scanning done by the tool is limited and the format has some similarities to another, e.g. PDF/A files require more bytes to be scanned than regular PDF. A false positive can be hard to spot because a match, is after all, a match. False positives can impact workflow routing and future preservation planning.

Fido was created in Python and utilized traditional regular expressions to match file formats with signatures. This meant converting the PRONOM signatures into a format that could be understood by a standard regular expression matching engine. Fido is used in Archivematica and is still maintained as part of the Open Preservation Foundations stewardship.

                            A file extension is part of a file’s name. The extension is commonly three characters in length and prefixed with a dot. For the file name, ‘example.txt’ the extension is .txt. Registries of extensions exist that they can be searched and an ID asigned to a file. A file extension has no bearing on the content of a file, as such, a file that has the file extension .pdf is not guaranteed to be &quot;Portable Document Format&quot; (PDF). A file may not have the right extension for a number of reasons, including for circumventing information security measures (e.g. certain upload types on a website).Users may also adopt a temporary naming scheme e.g. renaming a file .backup, or .tmp.Users may not know the appropriate extension and so might provide another, e.g. assigning .xls (Microsoft Excel) to a .csv (comma-separated-values table format).

                            A file format signature is a sequence, or sequences of bytes inside a digital file. Bytes become human readable when looked at through a hex (hexadecimal) editing tool. One may find the hexadecimal values 0xD0 0xCF 0x11 0xE0 (DOC FILE) at the beginning of a Microsoft Word file – 0x denotes hexadecimal. Taken verbatim, these four bytes can be used by a tool to categorise any files that also begin with the same sequence. The skill in crafting a good file format signature is finding a set of sequences unique enough to group all files belonging to a single file format; broad enough so as not to miss a single file; and narrow enough not to falsely identify other files – a false positive. File format signatures are often described in file format specifications but they may still need crafting into something more useful that can be used by tools such as DROID.

                            Fixity is the property of remaining fixed. That is, the features of a record that we can use to determine that a record has not been changed. Context, date ranges, materials used, and in the case of digital records, checksums enable us to demonstrate mathematically that a record has not been modified. Fixity is key in demonstrating authenticity and integrity.

                            Format identification has previously been accepted as the first step of digital preservation ‘knowing what you’ve got’ the volume of material that some organisations are responsible for, however, makes this an ideal, but not necessarily a practicality. File format identification means looking at a digital file’s data (it’s binary content) for patterns that match the structures of specific file formats. Reading the pattern &quot;PDF- 1.4&quot; at the beginning of some files, may for example, be a good indication that the file is going to be a &quot;Portable Document Format&quot; file (PDF). Where a binary pattern cannot be ascribed to a digital file, either one isn’t known, or the file doesn’t conform to one, then other clues may be used. File extension may be a clue as to a file format e.g. CSV (Comma Separated Values).File name may be another, e.g. consistently named files, DS_Store, or Thumbs.db.

                            Having understood checksums, one might also be interested in fuzzy hashes. These are used in an alternative way to the checksums discussed here.Fuzzy hashes are used to determine the similarity of content – e.g. to determine when only small changes have been made to a data stream.This property of fuzzy hashes can be exploited to perform content sentencing, or to point users to similar content if there is a record available.

The right, showing the characters that can be rendered using the ASCII encoding scheme, or another scheme supported by the tool such as EBCDIC.Hex editors are impotant tools for developing file format signatures.

Its primary application is the representation of binary numbers in the form of two digit bytes. Hexadecimal makes binary easier to read, for example, the number 255, in binary is, 0b11111111, and in hexadecimal is 0xFF. A hexadecimal number is often prefixed with the number zero and letter ‘x’ to indicate that the following characters are hexadecimal.

                            International Standard for Describing Functions (ISDF). Provides guidance for preparing descriptions of functions of corporate bodies associated with the creation and maintenance of archives. Function definition includes subfunction, business process, activity, task, transaction or other term in international, national or local usage. The standard states that analysis of the functions of corporate bodies is important as the basis for many record keeping activities. Functions are recognised as generally being more stable than administrative structures. Description of functions plays a vital role in explaining the provenance of records.

JHOVE currently supports over 14 different file formats including PNG, TIFF, and WAVE Audio. JHOVE can tell users whether their file is well-formed; valid; both; or neither. Rules that determine this are encoded in the tool and have been elicited from the file format specifications for those file types. JHOVE is currently maintained by the Open Preservation Foundation. It was originally developed by Harvard University Libraries (HUL) and Gary McGath.

                            Data created and made available using the strengths of the web-technology stack. Four main principles are followed:Use URIs (Universal Resource Identifiers) to name (identify) things.Use HTTP URIs so that these things can be looked up (interpreted, ‘dereferenced&#39; e.g. via web browser).Provide useful information about what a name identifies when it&#39;s looked up, using open standards such as RDF, SPARQL, etc.Refer to other things using their HTTP URI-based names when publishing data on the Web.

                            A free and open source operating system (OS) developed in the 90s by Finland Computer Scientist Linus Torvalds and based on Unix-like principles. Android smartphones are Linux based, as are a number of commodity devices such as digital video recorders. Linux is characterized by its ‘kernel’ which provides the core control of the underlying computer system. Distributions add features to the operating system and are as well known as the OS itself, e.g. Ubuntu, Raspbian, Debian, and Red Hat.

                            ✨Magic✨ number is often used as a synonym for file format signature.The etymology for the term dates back to the seventh version of the Unix operating system (1979).The use of magic numbers grew as requirements for them did. The use of the phrase file format signature seems to have come about through the maturisation of the field of digital preservation.

                            A standard for accessing and interacting with various web archives across the globe. Memento is a project led by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Old Dominion University. Rather than expecting people to know about the growing number of Web archives, and to guess which archive might hold an older version of the resource they’re looking for, Memento proposes to make archived content discoverable via the original URL that the searcher already knew about. Memento adds a time dimension web-archives, and perhaps its most well-known implementation is archive.org, aka. the internet archive.

                            Metadata describes the properties or context of another object. for example, the number of pages in a book, and the number of words. Metadata can be associated with physical or digital objects. Records may be self-describing; meaning that the metadata can be read from the file, e.g. author is sometimes encoded in a file separately from the content. Metadata can be derived from the digital object’s content, e.g. image resolution, audio length. The file system also has metadata which the operating system uses to describe a digital object; modification and creation dates are two such examples.

It aims to make it easier to run identification and characterisation at scale, and helps compare and combine the results of different tools. Nanite provides an API (application programming interface) for DROID where DROID currently doesn’t have an easy to work with API. Nanite was developed by Andy Jackson of the British Library and the UK Web Archive.

                            Obsolescence is the process of becoming obsolete. Obsolescence is identified as a cause for data potentially becoming unreadable. It is synonymous with the terms out-dated and no-longer used. Given the number of dependencies on which a piece of technology relies: Operating system; memory type; mains power voltage; creating application,etc. There are a number of components that we’re monitoring in digital preservation for obsolescence. We can mitigate obsolescence through a number of means, but there is no one-size fits all solution.

                            Offsets are important to the functionality of a signature, that is, where in a file will certain byte patterns (signature patterns) are expected to be found. DROID and Siegfried both offer customisations which limit the size of an offset. These customisations can be used to speed up format identification e.g. by scanning less data a scan can finish quicker, but this has its trade-offs.

                            Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (Working Group), initially developed the PREMIS data dictionary as a specification with the goal of creating an implementable set of &quot;core&quot; preservation metadata elements, with broad applicability within the digital preservation community. The PREMIS Editorial Committee coordinates revisions and implementation of the standard. PREMIS is system and encoding, agnostic. It defines &quot;what a preservation repository needs to know&quot;. As such the repository that implements PREMIS may find itself doing so in any way that is fit for that institution. PREMIS is designed to support the long-term preservation, and usability, of digital objects.

                            The DROID signature file contains more semantics than the signatures alone. To avoid two PUIDs being returned for a single file as much as possible, prioritization of signatures has to take place, that is, if a signature matches with higher priority over another, then that is returned in favour of the other. When looking at the records of signatures in PRONOM prioritizations are listed on the front page of the record, not the signature page. All this information is included in the signature file, so that is how DROID finds it all in one place.

A programming language is just a flavour of instructions that all need to be boiled down to something that the processor can understand – usually machine language. Programming languages usually differ in terms of abstraction, meaning that low-level languages work much closer to the hardware (closer to machine code) than high-level languages.

                            PRONOM is a digital preservation technical registry. It is maintained by The National Archives, UK. PRONOM’s purpose in the community is to be a centralised service for file format signatures. File format signatures are consumed by tools such as DROID, Siegfried, and Fido. A unique identifier is assigned to every file format that can be identified through these tools.

                            PRONOM delivers signature files to tools via web services. DROID for example will first use a web-service to check for new signatures. If they exist it will then communicate with a second web service to download those signatures in the form of a &#39;signature file&#39;. A second type of signature file, Container Signatures, are downloaded via more traditional web based techniques utilizing a web-page’s Last-modified date, to seek new data.

The latter is the result of a historical error when x-fmt identifiers were made available to the public. A subsequent decision to maintain x-fmt was made in favour of continuity as a standard. There is no longer a semantic difference between identifier types – that is the x- is no longer experimental, it is equivalent to the other type.

                            Records in Context Content Model (RiC-CM) is a proposed standard from the International Council of Archives. It is a descriptive standards that incorporates the four existing ICA description standards, ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), ISDF, and ISDIAH. The standard recognises changing technologies and embraces graph technologies for description. The standard emphasises the preservation of the context in which records live. Overall, the standard exists to support the management of records; preservation of records and their context; and the reuse of records.

                            A companion tool for Siegfried that allows the data source (signature file) used by Siegfried to be customized. Customizing includes the option of not using the entire corpus of signatures available to it. An example might include creating a singature file to just identify images, e.g. as a result of a digitization workflow. A smaller singature file can, theoretically, be quicker than the entire corpus.

                            A high level language that is compiled at run-time via a program called an interpreter. By storing a large number of more complex, yet common functions and procedures in an interpreter, the user can be free to call those function using fewer commands in a ‘script&#39;. A user can interact with data for example, without having to worry about underlying memory models of the computer. A scripting language cannot be run in absence of an interpreter so a dependency of running such code, for example, Ruby, or Python, is that their interpreters must be pre-installed on the host machine.

Examples of significant properties may be, word count, colour profile, interactivity, etc. Significant properties are not universal. They are speciifc to the record and the community the record belongs to. Strategies for preservation should be developed on the basis of a full analysis of the user(s) requirements.

                            A skeleton file is a mechanism for testing DROID or Siegfried when a file cannot be shared. A corpus of skeleton files can be created when other examples do not exist. Skeleton files contain only the bytes relevant to a potential signature match, and nonsense data in between to pad the format. The Skeleton Test Suite on GitHub is a good example of these files that enables developers to test for false positives and multiple matches, amongst other things.

                            Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard mechanism for querying (getting results from) a relational database. Relational databases are made up of many tables SQL needs to be able to look at all of these and filter data at the same time to be able to answe a user&#39;s queries. Relational databases use a schema which is strict and fixed. An atlernative is a graph database where the structure is easily extended - they are extensible.

                            Unicode (maintained by the Unicode Consortium) is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world&#39;s writing systems. The Unicode Standard contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts. Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings including UTF-8 and UTF-16.

                            A feature of a cryptographic hash function that makes it difficult to reverse engineer. The range of outputs for any given input is uniformly distributed meaning every possible output has an equal chance of occurring – you won’t see chunks of similar checksums output for similar (not the same) chunks of data.

                            Variable sequence (VAR). Some file format signatures have a moveable sequence specified. These sequences can be anywhere in the file and often require the tool to scan every byte which is slow. A key optimization of file format signatures is trying to remove variable sequences to replace them with fixed byte sequences (BOF or EOF) with larger ranges in which to find them.

                            Hardware or software based protection of the storage system such that content can be read but cannot be written to. Write-blocking is a forensics technique. Write blockers are central to digital forensics where the material collected from storage devices such as hard drives have important evidentiary value and must not have been tampered with.

                            Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) created originally by Adobe, but now an ISO standard. The standard can encode any set of metadata properties. A common use is for the encoding is to record the activities that have been performed on a file, for example, on an image, one could record post-digitization efforts to crop (remove excess parts of the image) and de-skew (straighten the image). The XMP can then be looked upon as an audit trail for the file.

/* START OF editor.js

This script starts a simple server listening on localhost.

* GET requests are served by local HTML/JS/CSS files.
* PATCH requests to / expect to receive an HTML fragment string in the body.
  This string is used to update the glossary file, replacing
    <div id="glossary-page-container"
      ...

This allows the editor to save any updates made in the UI.
